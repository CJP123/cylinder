## Install

``` sh
pip install cylinder
```

This basic model provides the core function for a step change
calculation in a mixed hot water cylinder

## How to use

Load some data that can be used to test the model - flow and electricity
pricing

``` python
# df = (pd.DataFrame(load_demand(path = Path('../data/drawprofiles'),bed=5,unit=4)))
# df.columns=["flow"]
# df = df.merge(load_power(path = Path('../data')), how='left', left_index=True, right_index=True)
# df.head()
```

Create a hot water cylinder object and initialise it with the data

``` python
hwc = HWC(T_set=70, T_deadband=2, element=3, radius=.2, height=1.5)
```

``` python
print(f'The HWC volume is {int(hwc.volume*1000)} liters')
print(f'The HWC surface area is {hwc.surface_area:.2f} m2')
print(f'The HWC has a {hwc.element:.2f} kW element')
```

    The HWC volume is 188 liters
    The HWC surface area is 2.14 m2
    The HWC has a 3.00 kW element

Default thermogram

Run the model for a single day on thermostat and plot the results
